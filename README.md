As seen in the examples from Van Gogh and Seurat, they use tiny points or lines to form the bigger picture. I want to use this technique to portray Abad's 'Wheel of Fortune.' I think this technique would provide a unique twist to the artwork as the use of varying sizes of points would allow me to add different visual effects.
