Major Assignment üé® 

## Imaging Technique üñºÔ∏è
<div id="image-table">
    <table>
	    <tr>
    	    <td style="padding:10px">
        	    <img src="assets/default.jpg" width="200"/>
      	    </td>
            <td style="padding:10px">
            	<img src="assets/Seascape-Port-en-Bessin-Georges-Seurat-Normandy-oil-canvas-1888.webp" width="300"/>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>
As seen in the examples from Van Gogh and Seurat, they use a technique that have tiny points or lines to form the bigger picture. The use of lines make it look like the artwork is flowing. This is the technique I want to use to portray Abad's 'Wheel of Fortune.' I think this technique would provide a unique twist to the artwork as the use of varying sizes of lines would allow me to add different visual effects. 

## Coding Technique
<div id="image-table">
    <table>
	    <tr>
    	    <td style="padding:10px">
        	    <img src="assets/Quiz%208-%20Design%20Programming.gif" width="200"/>
      	    </td>
            <td style="padding:10px">
            	<img src="assets/Screenshot 2023-09-29 at 18.43.40.png" width="200"/>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>
I explored how we can set a rule for a points' direction on the canvas and draw a line while these points move. I looked through several works that do this and they use functions such as map and use trigonometry. This would help me achieve the technique in part 1 because the works generated create a 'flow' or wave like artwork.
